You could say i love learning new stuff and always on the lookout for better ways to do things. New tech excites me just as much as basketball, ball is life :basketball: .

Just recently started contributing to Open Source Projects and really enjoy the feeling of being part of something bigger. In 2021 started to learn React. :rocket:

I was formed with a MVC methodology so Flask and microservices architectures are my thing, design patterns & Big O ftw. Love **codewars** :computer:.

I have come across several Udemy courses like Web Development using Django, Api Development with Flask and Node as well. I am proficient with RDBMS like MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, Redis and MongoDB.
