You could say i love learning new stuff and always on the lookout for better ways to do things. New tech excites me just as much as basketball, yes i'm a baller :basketball: and that's how i blow steam.

Just recently started contributing to Open Source Projects and really enjoy the feeling of being part of something bigger. In 2021 started to learn React :rocket:, trying to add the frontend to my stack. 

I was formed with a MVC methodology so Flask and microservices architectures are my thing, design patterns in python too. Coming across codewars :computer: some time ago made me have a thing for Big O and realize how algorithms can be double-edge swords, since then i like to implement different approaches in order to get a better solution. 

I have come across several Udemy courses like Web Development using Django, Api Development with Flask and Node as well. I am proficient with RDBMS like MySQL, SQL Server and Postgres. Know my way through some NoSQL like MongoDb and Redis.
