You could say i love learning new stuff and always on the lookout for better ways to do things. New tech excites me just as much as basketball, ball is life üèÄ .

I was formed with c++ and c# but then started working some projects with python, loved it so i became a pythonista, and now falling for elixir üß™, I'm also a fan of design patterns in the OO world and micro-services in SaaS.

I have come across several Udemy courses like Web Development using Django, Api Development with Flask and Node as well. I am proficient with SQL Server and Postgres. As well as Redis and MongoDB.
