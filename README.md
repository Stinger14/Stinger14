# Well, hello! :v:

## About me :eyes:

I am Maxly García, a python/elixir developer.

You could say i love learning new stuff and always on the lookout for better ways to do things. New tech excites me just as much as basketball, ball is life 🏀 .

I was formed with c++ but then began loving python and now falling for elixir 🧪, design patterns & Big O ftw. Love **codewars** 💻.

I have come across several Udemy courses like Web Development using Django, Api Development with Flask and Node as well. I am proficient with RDBMS like MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, Redis and MongoDB.
